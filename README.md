# Wheat-Kernel-Variety-Classification
Kernel Geometry Analysis Using Soft X-ray Imaging
This project focuses on classifying three varieties of wheat kernels — Kama, Rosa, and Canadian — using geometrical properties extracted from soft X-ray imaging. The objective is to build machine learning models capable of accurately distinguishing between these wheat types based on subtle differences in their internal structure.
